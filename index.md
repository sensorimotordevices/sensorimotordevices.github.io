# About our workshop

An emerging space in interface research is wearable devices that closely couple their sensing and actuation abilities. A well-known example is MetaLimbs, where sensed movements of the foot are directly mapped to the actuation of supernumerary robotic limbs. These systems are different from wearables focused on sensing, such as fitness trackers, or wearables focused on actuation, such as VR headsets. They are characterized by tight coupling between the user's action and the resulting digital feedback from the device, in time, space, and mode. The properties of this coupling are critical for the user's experience, including the user's sense of agency, body ownership, and experience of the surrounding world. Understanding such systems is an open challenge, which requires knowledge not only of computer science and HCI, but also Psychology, Physiology, Design, Engineering, Cognitive Neuroscience, and Control Theory. **This workshop aims to foster discussion between these diverse disciplines and to identify links and synergies in their work, ultimately developing a common understanding of future research directions for systems that intrinsically couple sensing and action.**

# Objectives & Outcomes
We aim to achieve the following objectives and tangible outcomes:

* Create a coherent outline of relevant artifacts, systems, and interfaces that successfully instantiate a close coupling between sensing and actuation to augment bodily experience (e.g., wearable and tangible interfaces, haptics, e-textiles), documenting these examples in an online collection similar to Haptipedia (https://haptipedia.org/).
* Identify common elements of experience, agency and control, and comprehensive understanding of the opportunities opened up by coupling sensing and action to augment the bodily experience.
* Generate a set of open research questions to be addressed in future work, creating research opportunities within a 5- and 50-year horizon
* Share theoretical methodological grounding between multi- and inter-disciplinary work, drawing on the diverse backgrounds of the community to outline a shared "success" criteria.
* Solidify a community, involving the creation of a special interest group, around sensorimotor devices to support researchers at various points in their careers in pursuing and contextualizing this work.


# Call for Participation

An emerging research direction are wearable systems in which sensing and actuation are synchronous, co-located, of the same mode, and with a temporal behavior, enabling integration with the user’s sensory and motor abilities. Such coupling opens exciting new opportunities for user experience, agency, and body ownership.

This one-day workshop offers an interdisciplinary forum for academics and practitioners to discuss opportunities, challenges, and long-term visions in this space. We intend to identify:

* Artifacts, systems, and interfaces that closely couple sensing and actuation to augment bodily experience (e.g., wearables, haptics, tangibles, e-textiles)
* Share methodological and theoretical grounding, as well as recognizing where these differ.
* Shared grounding across disciplines, including methods and metrics for validating "success"
* Opportunities and insights in this area, aiming to support researchers at various career stages.

We invite potential participants to share 1-3 relevant technologies or experiences (to be discussed in pre-workshop brainstorming). Each should be presented in a self-contained manner, together with a description of its relevance. Examples by other researchers should be appropriately cited and contextualized with thoughtful commentary. Please also indicate the possibility of bringing chosen examples as physical demos to the workshop, and a short biography of the participant(s).

* Submissions should be 2-5 pages long (incl. references) using the CHI Extended Abstracts format and submitted as non-anonymized PDF.
* The deadline for submission is February 13, 2025, midnight AoE.
* Quality submissions will be selected by the workshop team to ensure a diversity of disciplines, backgrounds, and career stages. We will notify applicants by March 10, 2025.

# Organizers
**Paul Strohmeier** leads the Sensorimotor Interaction group (senSInt) at the Max Planck Institute for Informatics (MPI-INF). His PhD work was honored with the SIGCHI Outstanding Dissertation Award. He has recently received an ERC Starting Grant for conducting research on kinesthetic perception, sensory augmentation, and on-body systems. Paul has co-hosted 8 events at ACM conferences (Workshops, Studios and SIGs) many of which are directly related to this proposal. Paul has also been instrumental in ensuring that such events have tangible outcomes, for example in the form of follow up workshops, magazine publications, and academic papers.

Laia Turmo Vidal is a Digital Futures Research Fellow at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden. Laia's work explores sensorimotor transformations facilitated by wearables and bio-responsive technologies, with the aim to create interactive experiences that are conducive to individual and collective care, health and wellbeing. Laia has facilitated body- and movement-centered design workshops at recent CHI, DIS, and IEEE World Haptics.

Gabriela Vega is a research assistant in the Sensorimotor Interaction Group at the MPI-INF, where her research focuses on developing wearables for Tactile AR and texture design. She is interested in human-computer interaction, haptics, AR, and tangibles for human augmentation and well-being.

Courtney N. Reed is a musician, performer, and assistant professor in the Institute for Digital Technologies, Loughborough University London, London, United Kingdom. Her work explores the dynamics of agency and control between human and body through vocal performance. She designs biosignal-based wearables for augmented singing and is interested in first-person methodologies and micro-phenomenology.

Alex Mazursky is a PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Chicago, where he designs wearable devices that provide tactile feedback, transforming otherwise passive objects and surfaces into interactive experiences. He engineers haptic actuators from the ground up, integrating actuators into custom devices that create diverse sensations—such as vibration, friction, pressure, and temperature—to augment physical and virtual spaces.

Easa AliAbbasi is a postdoctoral researcher in the Sensorimotor Interaction Group at MPI-INF, where his research focuses on understanding human tactile perception and developing tactile displays to convey sensory information. During his PhD studies, he investigated the electro-mechanical interactions between human fingers and voltage-induced touchscreens under electroadhesion.

Ana Tajadura-Jiménez is an Associate Professor in the DEI Interactive Systems Group at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, and an Honorary Research Fellow at the University College London Interaction Center. She leads the i\_mBODY lab, which focuses on interactive multisensory body-centered experiences at the intersection of HCI and neuroscience. She is the PI of the ERC-funded BODYinTRANSIT project, which explores the design of sensory technologies to alter body perceptions and promote positive changes in emotional and physical health in populations with body-related concerns. She has organized workshops in this space.

Jürgen Steimle is a Professor at Saarland University where he leads the Human-Computer Interaction Lab. Previously he was Senior Researcher at the MPI-INF and Visiting Assistant Professor at the MIT Media Lab. He holds a PhD in Computer Science from TU Darmstadt. Jürgen specializes in body-based interfaces that are soft and deformable, to offer novel opportunities for rich and expressive multi-sensory interaction.
