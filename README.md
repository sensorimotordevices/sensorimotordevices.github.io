"Soft is Hard: Some thoughts on organizing the challenges, and starting on the work"

Abstract: Fabricating things which are soft is a very important goal for the HCI component of the computational fabrication community.  Soft objects have critically important attributes when considered for human use.  Soft material -- textiles in particular -- are the only material which we keep in contact with our bodies 99% of the day.  And there are good reasons why this is true.  But while there is a very long history of humans creating with these materials, they can be challenging to use in a computational fabrication context.  For example, they can be unruly to handle in a fabrication machine, and hard to model or simulate, compared to rigid materials.
In this talk, I will first try to give some structure to the several different types of challenges we need to address in this area, and then turn to just a few specific exemplar projects I and my collaborators have undertaken within that structure.

"Energy Harvesting for Battery-Free Soft Wearables"

Abstract: Over the past decade, thereâ€™s been tremendous advancements in soft and highly stretchable circuitry for use in epidermal electronics for health monitoring, wearable computing, and soft robotics.
As these technologies continue to improve, there is increasing interest in new material architectures for energy harvesting and battery-free operation.
Several promising approaches leverage various sources of energy that are created by the body through repeated surface contact, kinetic motion, or heat.
As with the sensors and circuits that they power, these energy harvesting transducers should be soft and stretchable so that they conform to the human body without causing discomfort or impairing natural motion.
In this talk, I will present several methods for achieving fully battery-free functionality of soft wearable devices that rely on various energy harvesting modalities.
Specifically, I will show how liquid metal alloys like eutectic gallium indium (EGaIn) can be used to produce soft material architectures that can convert body heat or limb motion into electricity using thermoelectric or triboelectric coupling, respectively.
To demonstrate the practicality of these battery-free wearables, I will show how they can be used to power a variety of body-mounted electronic devices for temperature sensing, humidity sensing, pulse oximetry, signal processing, and wireless radio communication.
As time permits, I will also show how these EGaIn-based architectures can be extended to other applications related to soft robotics and intelligent soft materials.

## Abstract

Wearables have long been integral to human culture and daily life.  Recent advances in intelligent soft wearables have dramatically transformed how we interact with the world, enhancing our health, productivity, and overall well-being. These innovations, combining advanced sensor design, fabrication, and computational power, offer unprecedented opportunities for monitoring, assistance, and augmentation. However, the benefits of these advancements are not yet universally accessible. Economic and technical barriers often limit the reach of these technologies to domain-specific experts. There is a growing need for democratizing intelligent wearables that are scalable, seamlessly integrated, customized, and adaptive. By bringing researchers from relevant disciplines together, this workshop aims to identify the challenges and investigate opportunities for democratizing intelligent soft wearables within the HCI community via interactive demos, invited keynotes, and focused panel discussions.


## Introduction

Recent developments in materials science, digital fabrication, and applied machine learning have enabled significant advances in intelligent soft wearables. At the intersection of wearable technology and applied artificial intelligence, these wearables seamlessly integrate functionalities with the human body, serving as conformal sensing and actuation interfaces, and unobtrusively extract information and generate optimal feedback combined with advanced computational techniques. Some research efforts have been prioritizing functionality over conformability, either for sensing [2, 7, 10, 24] or actuation [4, 22, 25], but we propose to further investigate soft interfaces that conform to the body. They have already served as interactive interfaces [1, 8, 19, 23, 28], behavior monitoring and learning systems [13, 27, 29, 30], assistive wearables [5, 11, 14], human augmentation [9, 12, 18, 21], and entertainment [3, 6, 16, 20, 26], demonstrating great potential in HCI, healthcare, AR/VR, robotics, and space, among other applications.

However, despite their significant potential, most current intelligent wearables are still localized to specific parts of the body, function for only short periods, and are tailored to specific users and scenarios (as in ElectroDermis [15] or SmartSleeve[17]). Additionally, the design, fabrication, and application of intelligent soft wearables generally require domain-specific knowledge and interdisciplinary integration.

In this workshop, we aim to analyze the challenges and explore the opportunities in the democratization of such intelligent soft wearables, enabling them to be scalable, robust, customizable, and adaptive. The structure of the workshop is designed to maximize engagement through a combination of keynotes, interactive demos, group discussions, and expert panels.

## Scope: Goals & Topics

The democratization of intelligent soft wearables requires
interdisciplinary efforts. In this workshop, we focus on the following
research questions:

-   How do we effectively customize the form factor and functionalities
    of intelligent soft wearables for diverse individuals with
    significant differences in perception and needs?

-   How do we generalize the robust performance of intelligent soft
    wearables across diverse users and usage scenarios?

-   How do we efficiently scale the design and fabrication of
    intelligent soft wearable interfaces so that they can serve a
    broader community?

The goal of our workshop includes:

-   Bringing together researchers in the field to share their findings,
    practices, and insights.

-   Understanding the grand challenges in democratizing intelligent
    wearables.

-   Investigating the opportunities and potential in democratizing
    intelligent wearables from the design, fabrication, and
    computational perspectives.

-   Fostering collaboration among researchers from various fields to
    enrich the development of intelligent wearable devices for HCI
    through diverse perspectives.

Topics of interest for the workshop include, for example:

-   Accessible computational design

-   Digital fabrication toolkits

-   Scalable manufacturing processes for soft wearables

-   Generalizable sensing and actuation interfaces

-   Applied machine learning for wearables

-   Multi-function multimodal wearable ecosystems

-   Evaluating large-scale and long-term deployment

-   Personalization VS generic one-for-all wearables

-   Miniaturization for conformability
