# Pre-Workshop
The workshop's Call for Participation will be shared via mailing lists (e.g., ACM SIGCHI, UIST, Augmented Humans, NIME, etc.) to researchers in HCI, engineering, psychology, and related areas. Moreover, the organizers will leverage their extensive networks of experts to ensure that people in key communities are made aware of it. All workshop information will be easily accessible via our [workshop's website](https://sensorimotordevices.github.io), which will also include the complete program and accepted submissions as well as notes, sketches, and takeaways after the workshop.

We aim to draw attendance from diverse backgrounds (HCI, psychology, engineering, etc.) to facilitate discussion that identifies links across disciplines. Potential participants will be invited to submit a position paper (2-4 pages, following the ACM Template), in which they will describe one or multiple technologies, experiences, or experiments that explore closely coupled sensing and actuation; and 1-2 discussion points in relation to the four topic areas we propose. Submissions will be reviewed by the workshop organizing committee. A total of up to 15-20 participants will be invited to participate in the workshop based on their submissions. 

Prior to the workshop, participants and organizers will arrange each accepted submission together on a Miro board, where submissions will be clustered according to the topic themes (we anticipate themes of Agency, Self-Experience, World-Experience, and Control, among others that may emerge through discourse). We will form interest groups around these themes, which we will use for breakout discussions during the workshop. We will distribute the papers among participants and publicly on the workshop website. We will ask participants to familiarize themselves with all the papers and encourage them to add to the Miro board even before the workshop.

#### Introduction & Speed Conversing
The in person workshop will open with a brief introduction from the organizers, reiterating the goals and research questions to be addressed. This is followed by "speed conversing" to encourage attendees to connect with each other and exchange information. Attendees will give 60-second elevator pitches of their research and goals for the workshop to other randomly selected attendees and swap groups periodically. The goal is to foster 1 on 1 discussions amongst participants.

#### Focus Groups (Session 1)
In smaller groups, attendees will discuss each of the one four topic areas identified above, according to their interest: agency, experience of self, experience of others and the world, and control. The objective of this activity is to allow attendees to discuss shared and divergent methodological and theoretical grounding, and identify important challenges and opportunities regarding the future of sensorimotor interactions in relation to the topic area (for example, articulating research questions to be addressed in a 5-year horizon, or visions of how they would like to see the area progress in a 50-year horizon).

#### Demo Session
A demo session will provide new inputs to these discussions in the middle of the day. Participants and organizers will be invited to bring physical demos which relate to the workshop topic. We will discuss the implementation and interaction experience as well as how agency, including self-attribution and control are negotiated in these interactions.

#### Focus Groups (Session 2) & Closing
The workshop will conclude in a shared discussion, where the groups come back together to share their findings, incorporating themes from the Demo Session, and to identify commonalities and differences between groups. An approximate schedule for the workshop is as follows:

# Post Workshop
We are planning for three types of workshop follow-ups. The first is an online collection, inspired by websites such as [Haptipedia](https://haptipedia.is.tuebingen.mpg.de/), [Sensorwiki](sensorwiki.org/doku.php) or [Kobakant](kobakant.at/DIY). We will publish a curated set of Systems, Experiments, and Experiences relevant to researchers interested in this topic on our website.

The outcome of the workshop will be documented to share either in the form of a blog post (e.g. at ACM interactions) or an academic publication to reach researchers and practitioners beyond the CHI attendees. The purpose of this publication will be to define the field in a way that helps junior researchers identify relevant research problems, and more senior researchers contextualize and position their work for grant writing or similar activities, for example by articulating \textit{grand challenges} \cite{grandChallenge_shapeChanging} and \textit{opportunities} \cite{HInt} for sensorimotor interaction.

We also intend the workshop to support creating a community of researchers interested in sensorimotor interaction that extends beyond the workshop itself. For this purpose a proposal for a SIG will be submitted to CHI 2025. To foster community beyond the conference, we will create a dedicated online space (e.g., Discord community or Slack group) open to those who wish to participate, with the aim of having a shared space where discussions and collaborations can continue beyond the workshop and flourish. Finally, should we find interest from the broader community, we intend to follow up with a dedicated [Dagstuhl Seminar](https://www.dagstuhl.de/de/seminars/dagstuhl-seminars).
